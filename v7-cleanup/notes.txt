- I created the cleanup version, it's basiclly the files from v7, but I deleted the files here that weren't necessary 
(I left the client because I didn't know if we need it or not)
- I reorganized and added comments to the shell codes otehr than the exam.sh, because I'm not sure if we nned all the 
code there, or only the drop students lines (and I'm still having trouble running the project)
- I renamed the test_controller as controller
- I cleaned up the network.py, and created some helper functions, but we can change that back if we want

ToDo:
- Make sure everything is still running
- Clean the exam.sh file
- Check if the tests.py work (it should have some tests about the bandwidth of the channels, and making sure the 
messages are sent through the right nodes), if not we can delete it, I just thought it would be nice to present some tests
as well
- If client.py isn't needed then delete
