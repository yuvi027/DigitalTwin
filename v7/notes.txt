It is almost working now.
All cases are working, but going from a case back to original setup does not work.
It seems like the problem is that the _packet_in_handler() is not called when the switch receives a packet and it has no flow!?
The function is only called at the beginning, not after the flows are deleted.


We made a default shell code
However neither the default shell code or the default code in the controller is running in the beginning
